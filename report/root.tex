\section{INTRODUCTION}

Breast cancer is kind of a big issue I think.

First, Example text Example text Example text Example text.

\subsection{SCARF (reference 2)}

VIME (Variational Information Maximizing Exploration) is a method proposed by 
Yoon et al. in 2020. It is designed for semi-supervised learning, where the goal
 is to effectively utilize both labeled and unlabeled data. VIME leverages a
  variational information maximization framework to enhance the representation 
  learning process. The key components of VIME include a feature encoder, a 
  feature decoder, and a discriminator. The feature encoder maps input data to 
  a latent space, while the feature decoder reconstructs the input data from the 
  latent representation. The discriminator is used to distinguish between real and generated samples, promoting the learning of meaningful representations. VIME has shown promising results in various benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the performance of semi-supervised learning tasks.

\subsection{DeepSurv (reference 3)}

SCARF (Semi-supervised Classification by Augmented Random Forest) is a semi-supervised learning method proposed by
Zhu et al. in 2019. SCARF is designed to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data to improve the performance of classification tasks. The key idea behind SCARF is to augment the training data with pseudo-labels generated from the unlabeled data. SCARF utilizes a random forest classifier to assign pseudo-labels to the unlabeled data, which are then used to train a semi-supervised classifier. The augmented training data enables the classifier to learn from both labeled and unlabeled data, leading to improved performance. SCARF has been shown to outperform traditional supervised and semi-supervised learning methods in various benchmark datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in leveraging unlabeled data for classification tasks.

\subsection{Transformer (reference 4)}

DeepSurv is a deep learning model proposed by Katzman et al. in 2018 for survival analysis. DeepSurv is designed to predict the hazard function of patients based on their clinical and genomic features. The model leverages a deep neural network architecture to learn complex patterns in the data and predict the risk of an event occurring. DeepSurv has been shown to outperform traditional survival analysis methods in various benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting patient outcomes. The model has been widely used in clinical research and has the potential to improve patient care by providing accurate risk predictions.

\section{CONCLUSION}

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
